# 🧾 Automated Report Generator (CSV to PDF)

This project is part of my CodTech internship under the Python Programming domain. It demonstrates how Python can be used to automate the generation of professional PDF reports from uploaded CSV data. The program reads a dataset, processes it into a formatted table, and automatically adds a data visualization chart. The entire workflow is implemented in Google Colab, making it easy to upload files and instantly generate reports without any manual formatting.

The system dynamically adapts to any dataset by detecting column types and choosing the appropriate visualization (bar chart or scatter plot). This automation reduces repetitive work, ensures accuracy, and highlights the power of Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **fpdf** for data processing, visualization, and reporting.
